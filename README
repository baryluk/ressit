Simple script for submiting links to reddit, based
on existing RSS feed.

Requires:
  reddit_api >= 1.0     (https://github.com/mellort/reddit_api)
  feedparser >= 5.0.1   (apt-get install python-feedparser)

Uses shelve module (which uses anydbm, which uses Berkley DB)
for storing what was uploaded.

Example configuration in file example_config.ini,
pass it as argument to ressit.py

Know what are you doing before using this script.
Read reddit term of usage, and do not spam reddit unacassarly.
Not following sane behaviour will end with account or IP address blocked.
